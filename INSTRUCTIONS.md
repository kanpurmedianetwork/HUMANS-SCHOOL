# Branding Instructions

To customize the branding of **Humans School**, follow these guidelines to create and upload your assets.

## 1. Logo
*   **File Name**: `logo.png`
*   **Location**: `humans-school/public/logo.png`
*   **Format**: PNG (Transparent background is **essential**).
*   **Recommended Size**:
    *   **Height**: ~100px to 200px (The site displays it at 40px height, so this ensures high quality on retina screens).
    *   **Aspect Ratio**: Flexible, but a horizontal rectangle (e.g., 3:1 or 4:1) works best if it includes text. If it is just a symbol, 1:1 is fine.
    *   **Color**: Ensure it contrasts well with a **white** background (since the Navbar is white).

## 2. Favicon
*   **File Name**: `favicon.ico`
*   **Location**: `humans-school/public/favicon.ico`
*   **Format**: ICO file (preferred) or PNG (rename to .ico if needed, though real conversion is better).
*   **Recommended Size**: Standard 32x32 pixels or 16x16 pixels.

## 3. How to Upload
1.  Delete the existing `logo.png` (if any) in the `public` folder.
2.  Paste your new `logo.png` and `favicon.ico` into the `public` folder.
3.  Refresh the website.
